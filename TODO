Things that need to be done

* don't load animations from disk every time
* make timing based on clock, not on frames
	- clamped to 30ms. is this the best?
* segfault when deleting Bomb::animation_2. why?
* partial movement should be allowed
* bomb regeneration

Done

* time limit < 5 doesn't make sense
